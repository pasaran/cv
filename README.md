## Experience

### 2015-2020. Head of Frontend Engineering at Auto.ru

[Auto.ru](https://auto.ru) (auto classifieds website) was acquired by Yandex in the late 2014
and I joined the project as a head of front-end dev team.
I had to reorganize the existing team and to replace old php/jquery codebase with modern technologies.

Responsibilities:

  * Team management (replacing team members, hiring new people, teaching, 1-on-1).
  * Talking/teaching about new technologies to our team.
  * Planning our work together with other teams (design, backend, testing).
  * Choosing proper technologies, libraries, tools and incorporating them into our dev process.
    We replaced php with Node.js and Express. Later we started migration to React and TypeScript.
  * Writing tools and libraries if we couldn't find analogue in the open-source world.
    Like [descript](https://github.com/pasaran/descript) — data aggregation library
    and [jpath](https://github.com/pasaran/nommon/blob/master/docs/jpath.md) — xpath-like query library.
  * Code reviewing
  * And of course writing a lot of JS/TS.

My responsibility was to prototype a new tech stack for that project:
server side JS (we used Firefox JS engine), working with XML and XSLT in a browser,
new JS framework for SPA etc. And then with the rest of the team to finish the project using all of this tech.
Later when we decided to replace XSLT I wrote XSLT-inspired template engine in JS — [yate](https://github.com/pasaran/yate).
